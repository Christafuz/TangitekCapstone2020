# TangitekCapstone2020
This repository serves to document in detail the progress made by the 2020 Capstone team working under Dr. Brano Pejcinovic, sponsored by Tangitek. 

Th RCSe Simulation and Measurement folder describes how to perform RCS simulations in ANSYS HFSS, how to perform RCS measurements, and how to calculate RCS results from measured data and compare with simulated RCS results.  

The NRL Arch folder contains information that describes how to use the modified NRL Arch for reflectivity measurements. 

The VNA Automation folder shows how to automate a VNA using VEEsoftware. 

The TurnTable Code folder describes how to operate the Dynamixel Motor for use with a turntable.

Also included in the main folder are proposals, reports, and the Instruction_Manual.pdf document, which serves as a master document describing how to use each of the features of our measurement system. Initial_Project_Proposal.pdf was te proposal we had started with on this project, but after the covid-19 pandemic, we renegotiated our deliverables and agreed upon the proposal outlined in Amended_Project_Proposal.pdf.
